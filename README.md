# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis: 

The purpose is to create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Then, using Pandas and Matplotlib, create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. Based on the results will determine how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.

## Results:

Among the different city types, Urban is the city type with the overall highest fares between January-April 2019. This is due to the fact thet the total rides are much higher compared to Suburban or Rural city types.  Below is a snap shot of the data.

## Summary: 

In order to increase fare revenue in Rural and Suburban city types, the CEO must increase the amount of total drivers while decreasing the average far per driver. Also the CEO should raise the fare on the busiest month during the year to increase fare revenue.
